# Nutirfy App
The Nutrify App is a tool for anyone seeking to optimize their diet, maintain a balanced nutritional intake, and make informed meal choices at Bentley University. Users can input their weight, height, age, gender, and activity level to calculate their daily caloric and macronutrient needs using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. The app provides up-to-date menus for each day of the week and meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner), sourced from the dining hall's Sodexo offerings. On top of that, based on the user's calculated nutritional needs, the app provides tailored recommendations if their meal plan lacks sufficient protein, carbohydrates, or fats.
